# macOS System and Application Tester

A **guided validation script** for macOS environments managed by Jamf.  
It runs system, network, security, and MDM checks, then launches selected applications one by one, prompting testers to record whether they work. Results are written to a timestamped CSV on the Desktop. It is designed to help **Jamf admins or technicians test macOS applications during upgrades and updates**.
