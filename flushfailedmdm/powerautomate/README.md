# Power Automate Workflow for Clearing Failed MDM Commands

This document outlines the Power Automate flow used in conjunction with the `flushfailedmdm.sh` script. The flow receives data from a Jamf-managed macOS device and conditionally clears failed MDM commands via API calls.

## üì∏ Power Automate Flow Overview

### PA Flow 1 ‚Äì HTTP Trigger & Bearer Token Generation

This initial step receives the webhook payload and authenticates to Jamf Pro.

- Trigger: **When an HTTP request is received**
- Compose/Parse: Reads incoming JSON from the script
- HTTP Call: Generates a bearer token using the Jamf Pro API

---

### PA Flow 2 ‚Äì Token Storage, Fetching Failed Commands

This part initializes a variable with the bearer token and queries the Jamf Pro API to get failed MDM commands.

- Initialize Variable: Stores the bearer token
- HTTP Call: Gets failed MDM commands for the given Jamf Pro computer ID
- Parse XML: Extracts relevant xml response

---

### PA Flow 3 ‚Äì Conditional Handling & Deletion

Checks if failed MDM commands exist. If so, deletes them via a follow-up API call.

- Condition: If failed MDM results in xml exists then..
- HTTP Delete: Sends delete requests to Jamf Pro to clear commands
- Nothing is done on if results do not match

---

### PA Flow 4 ‚Äì Invalidate Token

Cleans up by invalidating the bearer token used during the session.

- HTTP Call: Sends a `POST` to invalidate the token
- This helps with security and avoids token reuse

---

### üì¶ Inputs

- `serial` ‚Äì Device serial number
- `comjssid` ‚Äì Jamf Pro computer ID
- `user` ‚Äì Current console user
- `email` ‚Äì (Optional) User email address
- `timestamp` ‚Äì Trigger time

---

### üîê Notes on Security

- The script must securely POST to this flow‚Äôs HTTP endpoint.
- The flow uses dynamic Bearer token generation ‚Äî the credentials used should have limited Jamf Pro permissions.
- Always invalidate tokens after usage.
