# üßë‚Äçüíª Jamf and Power Automate Script - Flush Failed MDM

Flush failed MDM commands on macOS via Power Automate and Jamf.


## `create_flush_failed_mdm.sh`

This script checks the last run date and, if the delay threshold is met, sends MDM info to a Power Automate webhook to trigger clearing of failed commands. Intended for use in Jamf with a LaunchDaemon.

### üìù Description

- Uses Jamf Pro Parameter 4 to send data to Power Automate
- Optionally reads inventory data from a custom plist (via configuration profile)
- LaunchDaemon runs script every 1 hour
- Gracefully exits if last run recently

1. Create `flushfailedmdm.sh` and place in `/Library/Scripts/` on target Macs.
2. Create a LaunchDaemon using `edu.sodm.clearfailedcommands.plist`.
3. Ensure Jamf sends the webhook URL as `$4` in your policy.

### Requirements

- macOS device managed by Jamf Pro
- Power Automate webhook URL passed in via `$4`
- A configuration profile to populate `/Library/Managed Preferences/info.plist`
