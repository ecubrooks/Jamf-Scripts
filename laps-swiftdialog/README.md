## üîê Security Notes

To securely authenticate with the Jamf Pro API, the following **macOS Keychain items must be created** on the client machine running this script:

- `JSSCID` ‚Äì contains the **Client ID**
- `JSSCIDSRT` ‚Äì contains the **Client Secret**

These are used to generate a secure bearer token for API access without hardcoding credentials into the script or Jamf.  

Use the following commands to manually create them:

```bash
# Store the Jamf Client ID
security add-generic-password -a "JamfID" -s "JSSID" -w "$CLIENT_ID" -T "/usr/bin/security" "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain"

# Store the Jamf Client Secret
security add-generic-password -a "JamfSecret" -s "JSSCIDSRT" -w "$SECRET" -T "/usr/bin/security" "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain"
