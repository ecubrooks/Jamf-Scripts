# Policy Installer - SwiftDialog

This script provides a SwiftDialog-based user interface for executing one or more Jamf policy triggers. It's designed to provide users with real-time visual feedback while Jamf runs a series of custom policies behind the scenes.

* Dynamically builds SwiftDialog list items and progress display
